# Snake Game

This repository contains a simple Snake game implemented using the `pygame` library. The game features basic mechanics where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow, while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.

## Overview

The Snake Game provides a classic arcade experience where the player maneuvers a snake around the screen, collects food, and avoids obstacles. The game is displayed using a graphical interface provided by `pygame`.

## Features

- **Classic Snake Gameplay**: Control the snake to eat food and grow longer.
- **Score Display**: Shows the current score based on the length of the snake.
- **Game Over Handling**: The game displays a message and allows the player to restart or quit.
- **Food Generation**: Randomly places food on the screen.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pygame` (install via `pip install pygame`)

## How to Run

1. **Clone this Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game.git
1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd snake-game
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
1. **Run the Game**:
   ```bash
   python snake_game.py

## Code Explanation

- **`Your_score(score)`**: Renders the current score on the screen.
- **`our_snake(snake_block, snake_list)`**: Draws the snake on the screen.
- **`message(msg, color)`**: Displays a message on the screen.
- **`gameLoop()`**: Contains the main game logic, including event handling, snake movement, collision detection, and game over conditions.

## Usage

- **Start the Game**: Run the script, and the game window will appear.
- **Control the Snake**: Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake (left, right, up, down).
- **Eat Food**: Navigate the snake to the food to grow longer and increase your score.
- **Avoid Collisions**: Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body to prevent a game over.
- **Game Over**: When the game is over, press `ESC` to quit or `SpaceBar` to restart the game.
